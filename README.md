# QueryBot

It is a practice project where I have built the front end using JavaScript, React framework and backend in Python, Flask framework. To answer the questions, I have used API of llama03-07b model from Groq. The response time of algorithm and app is fast, it takes less than 4 seconds.

I have attached 2 folders one for front-end and another for back-end. To run the code, clone the repository and install all packages from requirement.txt.
